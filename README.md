# Instructions
When the user goes on the gitconnected website, they are first introduced to the homepage. Here, the user can sign up for an account or sign in if they already have an account. Depending on whether the user is a developer or employer, they can create their own respective account. Once they create an account and login, the user will be taken to the feed page that either shows a developer available jobs, or shows an employer available developers.
